# csgo-deathmatch 

Some SourceMod plugins for making a custom deathmatch mode in CS:GO.
The plugins are completely independent and can be used seperately.


!!Any plugins with version < 1.0 are very WIP!!

How to use:
Install SourceMod then take any of the compiled plugins from /compiled/ and put it in your server's /sourcemod/plugins/ folder.

Plugins:

Commands:
dm_health_kill
dm_health_kill_headshot

dm_ammo_kill_headshot
